# Analysis of Earthquake Occurrences in the Philippines

The Pacific Ring of Fire is a region in the Earth where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur. The Philippines is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The purpose of this project is to discover how frequently earthquakes occur in the Philippines every year (Is there a decrease or increase in frequency yearly?). Also to identify the relationship among location, magnitude and focal depth.

The dataset was sourced from [PHIVOLCS Latest Earthquake Information](https://earthquake.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/) using [web scraper](https://webscraper.io/), a Google Chrome extension. The data included from 2018 up to 2022.
