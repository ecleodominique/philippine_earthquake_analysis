## Conclusions and Recommendations

* The Philippines consistently experiences a relatively stable number of earthquakes each year, except for a noticeable deviation in 2018. This may be attributed to limitations in technology during that period, affecting the accuracy and comprehensiveness of earthquake detection and reporting.
* The majority of recorded earthquakes in the Philippines have shallow focal depths, specifically less than 70km. This characteristic suggests that the seismic activity is primarily concentrated in the upper crust of the Earth, making it more perceptible and potentially impactful on the surface.
* While the majority of earthquakes exhibit shallow focal depths (less than 5km), there is a significant spike around 30km depth. This sudden increase aligns with the Mohorovičić discontinuity, indicating a transition zone in the Earth's crust. Further investigation into seismic processes in this specific depth range could provide valuable insights into the region's geological dynamics.
* The region of Mindanao stands out as a hotspot for high-magnitude earthquakes. This observation could be indicative of a localized geological setting conducive to the generation of more powerful seismic events. Understanding the specific geological features and tectonic interactions in Mindanao is crucial for assessing and mitigating earthquake-related risks in this area.

Considering the findings, here are some recommendations
1. **Enhance Seismic Monitoring Technology:**
   Given the potential impact of technological limitations on earthquake data in 2018, there is a need to continually invest in and upgrade seismic monitoring technology. This will ensure more accurate and comprehensive data collection, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of seismic activity in the Philippines.

2. **In-Depth Study of 30km Focal Depth Spike:**
   The sudden spike in earthquakes at around 30km focal depth warrants a detailed investigation. Conducting targeted studies and analyses in this specific depth range can provide valuable insights into the geological processes occurring at the Mohorovičić discontinuity and contribute to a better understanding of seismic behavior in the region.

3. **Localized Risk Assessment for Mindanao:**
   Recognizing Mindanao as a hotspot for high-magnitude earthquakes, it is imperative to conduct a thorough risk assessment for this region. This should include a comprehensive geological survey, evaluation of infrastructure resilience, and development of localized emergency response plans to mitigate the potential impact of future seismic events.

4. **Public Awareness and Preparedness Programs:**
   Given the seismic nature of the Philippines, there is a need for robust public awareness and preparedness programs. Educating the population on earthquake risks, safety measures, and emergency response protocols can significantly reduce the potential human and material impact of seismic events.

By addressing these recommendations, the Philippines can enhance its earthquake resilience and response capabilities, ultimately minimizing the societal impact of seismic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire region.
